## Music DMCA and You

Have you ever had your audio muted on a clip? No? Well consider yourself lucky.
Music DMCA issues have become more common than ever, and it is become vital for streamers
to know what audio can and cannot be monetized, especially once you become an affiliate.
However, if you haven't gotten to the affiliate point yet, it is never too early to start practicing great
habits, such as having a `Now Playing` or to find places where you can stream legal music.

I highly recommend the Twitch DMCA Playlist. It has lots of great songs on it and is perfect for background noise,
which is what most people want music for anyway.

Secondly, there is PretzelRocks, which is a spotify-like application that is ALL free to use music. At least,
so it advertises. Some folks have complained that these songs have gotten them in trouble still, but a lot
of those reviews are from 2019. Thankfully, one strike of DMCA isn't going to ruin you, you will get a warning.

Finally, and I don't know if I super recommend it, because it isn't all fair game, is to use soundcloud.
There are plenty of free to use songs on this platform, but before you just go and hit play, do research and
make a playlist of DMCA Okay songs. I love to recommend soundcloud because there are many widgets already created
for this platform, including ones that let your viewers pick songs!

Reminder: you are responsible for the sounds on your stream. So if you prefer to stay kid friendly, mayhaps it be
a good idea to not allow requests/viewers to control things.

DMCA is not something most small time streamers have to worry about, but it is something I still encourage anyone
seeking to build a following to take note of and establish great habits. The last thing you want is to get raided
by a popular streamer and have your VODs muted or have your stream demonetized because you did not do your homework.
