## Stream Layout 101

This `README` and overall repo is to help people
who are interested in creating their own overlays for any type of tournament
that meets your fancy. I come from the Fighting Game background -- so all
of my examples will be related to that. You are free to fork this repo and change
anything you may need. Licenses do apply where applicable, such as the use of the
`StreamController` which is owned and created by FARP. [TwitterLink/WebsiteLink]

I intend on building on FARP's `StreamController` and will document where my
changes take place and how it effect the code, if at all. For now, as of
May 2020 -- there are no changes required and you can use the `StreamController`
application as it is when you first download it.

While I will be going over things in detail during my stream, I will not do
so in these `README`s. I will always link videos and other documentation for
folks to learn to use everything. I recommend using my streams to follow along
and learn the bare minimum of things you need to have a successful stream.
Should you ever need more help, basic questions can be sent to my [Twitter](www.twitter.com/theiceyglaceon).

I personally test any code items with OBS -- if you use XSPLIT or any other software,
I cannot help you so be fairly aware. I will also be linking some other softwares for
folks who have already made some fancy widgets. Most of the concepts will carry over
to Streamlabs OBS. However, things like notifications and whatnot will be easier in
Streamlabs and I would highly recommend your day to day streamer use this platform.

  This repo is made available for anyone to take and modify as they see fit. I do not own FARP's StreamController
  and only claim my own personal additions to the program once they are implemented. My designs for templates
  are for personal use only as well as only for learning purposes in that matter. Should there be any viable designs put into this repo that are suitable for a stream, I ask you credit me. If you modify any of my code, templates, or otherwise anything else in their repo, you are required to offer it up for open source so that others may use it. This means it cannot be behind a paywall or "closed source" or "proprietary". I reserve the right to file take downs of any of my work being used that is not documented for others' learning or free usage. Full License is included in this repo.
