# Stream Controller Documentation [Internal]

For documenting things I've found and things people should know.

0. In order for these files to work out of the box, I made these assumptions:
  a. You have installed FARP's `.exe` file of `StreamController` on your local machine. I include a shortcut, not an install in my folders.
  b. You have OBS or a working streaming service that can handle these files. I test with OBS. I can't help you with XSPLIT.
1. Never change the `<format>` tag from 2, unless it was distributed to you that way.
2. Stream Controller will currently default to the original layout if you mess up your xml settings.
3. TweenMax - The animation javascript library used (also know as gsap in 2020). Would recommend learning this before the first widget stream.
